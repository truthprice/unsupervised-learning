# Unsupervised-Learning

## Description

The purpose and motivation of this project is to find a better way to predict myopia. Through this project, the goal was to see if there are distinct groups of patients that are prone to myopia. If such groups exist, it would be easier treat and analyze these patients. The project makes use of unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze data and determine if groups of patients exist. A scatter plot was created to determine grouping and an elbow curve was used to determine the number of possible groups in our data. The recommendation is present at the end of the jupyter notebook file titled "Myopia_Clusters."
